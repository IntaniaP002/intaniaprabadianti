            <li>MEET THE WOODS <br>
                The category of golf clubs called "woods" includes the driver and the fairway woods. The woods are the clubs with the largest heads and with the longest shafts. Golfers can swing them the fastest, and they are used for the longest shots, including strokes played from the teeing ground

            <br>
            <li>MEET THE IRONS <br>
                Irons come in numbered sets, usually ranging from 3-iron through 9-iron or pitching wedge. They have smaller clubheads than woods. They are generally used on shots from the fairway, or for tee shots on short holes
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>MEET THE HYBRIDS <br>
                Think of the clubhead of a hybrid as a cross between a wood and an iron. Hence the name "hybrid". That's because hybrids are considered "iron-replacement clubs," meaning that many golfers find them easier to hit than the irons they replace
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>MEET THE WEDGES <br>
                The category of wedges includes the pitching wedge, gap wedge, sand wedge and lob wedge. They are used for shorter approach shots into greens, for chips and pitches around greens, and for playing out of sand bunkers
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>MEET THE PUTTER <br>
                Putters are the most-specialized golf clubs, and the type of club that comes in the widest varieties of shapes and sizes. Putters are used for, well, putting. They are the clubs golfers use on the putting greens, for the last strokes played on a golf hole - for knocking the ball into the hole
