            Hats - the hats that people use when on the course range from standard baseball caps to old-school flat caps. The conclusion is that there isn't one specific type of hat for the game, but rather the players choose the best golf hat for them. A good piece of advice would be to pick a hat that's appropriate for the given season (summer, winter, etc.)

            <br>
            Shoes - similar to the hats, the type of shoes that golfers wear are usually a matter of personal preference. Many players use sneakers, some use moccasins or sandals, while others choose shoes specifically made for golf.

            Sunglasses - this accessory is quite important especially when playing during sunny, summer days. The difference between 'normal' sunglasses and golf sunglasses is that the former have lenses which are cut differently. They are designed so that the player always has a clear and sharp view all while having their eyes protected from the rays.

            Gloves - golf gloves provide players with a better grip as well as protection for their hands. Golfers wear only one glove, and they do so on the hand which grips the club. The main factors that you need to consider before buying are the size and the hand (left/right) that holds the club.
